*"Quick follow me before it changes again!"* I remember my father saying.
*"Come on hurry up or we won't make it!"* he continued.
We made it to our home in time and as soon as we came inside we hid in the smallest room in our house.
This was the first of two times my father had saved me when gravity was about to change again, however this time he survived...
** **
** **
It all started with slight signs, we suspected it was due to global warming because we were blatantly ignoring the little time we had left to stop it.
Some of the slight signs were:
Gravity had slowed down from 9.807 m/s² to 8.349 m/s².
Some objects made of materials with a lower density than water fell a lot slower, some even floating.
We wanted to do something... well some of us but we had already gone past the point of no return, this was an unstoppable event, all we could do was wait for what was to come and hope it wouldn't destroy us
But unfortunately... it did, the following few years billions of people died due to the new circumstances.
The population of the world went from 7.8 billion to only 4.5 million in 4 years.
The ones that adapted to the new world had hell to go through: Gravity changing direction every two hours, 30% of all freshwater disappearing, Unusually high temperatures with max 32°C in the winter and 43°C in the summer and gravity changing strength every so often.
Due to freshwater becoming so scarce massive fights broke out between multiple groups that had been doing a great job surviving before.
To adapt to the new temperature and circumstances multiple groups decided to sleep during the day and do everything during the night.
I was in one of those groups, it was one of the largest, but after the water fights started the members decreased quickly, we went from having 54 members to 35 to 23 to 11.]

My father and I decided that we were gonna try to get some supplies.
There was an old grocery store about five kilometers to the west, the nearest other group was about twenty kilometers east so it may not have been raided yet
We grabbed the watches that would notify us when a new gravity change was about to come and waited for the next gravity change that put gravity at its normal orientation again.
We had two hours to find supplies. If we weren't going to make this, it wasn't due to a lack of effort.
Gravity wasn't too strong right now so we had that as an advantage.
Being outside was never pretty: everything was everywhere, There were blood splatters every so often of people who didn't make it home in time and seeing the streets empty just made me feel hollow inside, like a part of me had disappeared with everyone else.
We had been walking for roughly twenty minutes, we were about 3.7 kilometers away from the grocery store.
The warm weather did do a number on us, we arrived but were drenched in sweat, the trip back wouldn't be comfortable.
We looked for all the canned supplies and found a big stack of about 32 cans.
We also found around 56 bottles of water.
*"Damn we're lucky to have still found this place, if it had already been raided we'd have been fucked."* my father said.
*"Yeah, we need to put the supplies in our bags, we don't have a lot of time left, we need to hurry to our shelter!"* I replied.
We put the supplies in both our bags, I took the food and my father took the water.
We had big bags, they slowed us down a bit but we needed to get supplies for multiple people so we had to.
If we were to fuck this up, we wouldn't be the only victims.
We went home at a steady pace, we were getting close when our watches went off, we only had a minute left.
The door of our shelter was already open, the others had opened it considering we didn't have the time to open it on our own.
*"Quick throw your bag inside, the lighter gravity will make it get further."* my father exclaimed.
I threw the bag it landed inside after a few seconds of air time, my fathers' bag landed inside three seconds after.
*"we're not gonna make it."* I yelled out.
*"One of us will."* dad replied.
*"What the fuck are you tal-"* I couldn't even finish my sentence.
*"Wait wait no dad no please don't you'll die."* I said as he picked me up and got ready to throw me.
*"I don't care, as long as you survive I don't care if I die."* he replied.
He threw me and I landed inside after around twelve seconds of air time.
*"Dad! Please hurry up"* I yelled out.
But it was too late, fate had already made a choice and had chosen that my father had to die.
*"I'll always love you, Casper, Even in death you will always be my little boy."* he said as he was flung left...]
