*"Shit!"* I muttered applying pressure to the wound I had gotten.
*"Why didn't I stay in the bunker!"*
I looked around the room hoping to find any medical supplies nearby.
*"They'll be here soon, I need to find a way to escape!"*
*"Shit shit shit shit shit!"*
*"I can't stop the bleeding!"*
I should have never answered their distress call, I was doing good on my own, why did I long for the company of people I didn't need to survive.
The one time I tried to be social it ended up being my death...

It was a hot day in the summer of 2034, I was twelve years old, I had a dry throat so I went to get a glass of water, I had just grabbed a glass and was about to fill it with water when I looked outside.
To be frank I wish I never did.
What I saw will never leave my mind, there was a rotting corpse in front of the door, it was sickening, it had bloodshot eyes, torn lips, a broken leg and part of its skull was gone.
Blood was everywhere.
Nearly puking I ran to the kitchen to get a knife or anything to defend myself.
My sister Jane heard all the ruckus and when she looked up all I heard was an ear-shattering scream.
*"WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING"*
She screamed pointing at the corpse.
*"I'm not sure, what I do know is we need to keep it the hell out of this house."* I replied.
** ** 
This was the day it started, the day normal life changed into a living hell.]

*"I need to go, I need to find medical supplies before I bleed to death!"* I said.
I stood up and started limping to the bathroom.
I opened the cabinet looking for anything that would help me, luckily I found some bandages and disinfectant.
I had to disinfect my wounds so I got ready for what was about to come.
*"This is gonna hurt like shit, but I have to do this if I wanna make it through this hell."* I said.
I screwed the cap off of the disinfectant slowly pouring some on the wound on my leg.
I groaned in pain at the stinging feeling of the alcohol-filled substance making contact with my wounds...

*"Jane did we unlock the door earlier?"* I said.
*"Oh shit we did, quick we need to lock it!"* Jane replied.
I grabbed the keys and ran to the door, I was about to lock it when I was violently pushed away.
We were too late, it had figured out how to use the door.
*"That's it... we're dead..."* I said.
*"Do you still have that knife?"* Jane asked.
*"No, I dropped it on the couch earlier, you keep an eye on that thing and I'll go get it!"*
I ran to the couch and grabbed the knife, I turned around and froze in terror.
Jane was looking at me so she didn't notice the being jumping at her.
*"JANE! RUN! NOW!"* I yelled.
I was too late, it grabbed her and slammed her into the ground before sticking its teeth into the side of her neck and tearing out a big chunk of her flesh.
Blood started gushing out of the wound it had given her, she looked at me in utter terror.
*"R- run and g- get out of h- here before you get ki-"*
Before she could finish her sentence it raised her head and sank its teeth into her throat before tearing out her larynx and gulping it down.
Her head slowly fell to the ground, blood still gushing out of her neck.
My sister had just been killed and I didn't do a thing to help her.]

*"Alright I have disinfected the wound, now just to bandage it up"* I said grabbing the bandage.
I tightly wrapped it around my leg where the gash was located.
*"This is gonna hurt like shit"* I muttered.
I grabbed a nearby stapler and \*click\* \*click\* \*click\* \*click\* \*click\*.
I nearly screamed out in pain.
I had disinfected and covered the wound so I'd be safe for a while.

I stood there, my body frozen in terror
*"J- Jane"* I said, tears forming in my eyes.
I stared at the being and felt the terror I was in transform into pure hatred.
*"YOU MOTHERFUCKER!"* I screamed at the top of my lungs while running to the corpse and plunging the knife deep into its skull before pulling it out and continuously stabbing it.
After about twelve stabs I stopped, I didn't assume it'd survive that but I cut off its head just in case.
I ran to my sister and turned her over, no pulse, I was too late.
*"No no no no please"* 
*"Please I need you"* I said tears forming in my eyes.
I fell to my knees and started crying.
*"Why you Jane, you didn't deserve this!"* I yelled clasping her cold hand.
*"I will avenge you, Jane, even if I were to die in the process I will kill as many zombies as I can!"* I said softly.
I stood up tears still forming in my eyes and grabbed a backpack and filled one part up with sharp knives, the other with water and food supplies and the other with other items I could have needed at some point such as bandages.
*"Goodbye sister."* I said.
*"I will miss you."*]
