I was a young girl when these events unfolded, I think I was around fifteen when it happened.
I was looking around in the attic for some stuff for my mom, she had sent me to find her old ring.
I was rummaging through the third box when I found a pocket watch.
*"Ooooooh what's this?"* I said inspecting the old clockwork.
*"Ooooooh what's th-"* I stopped, didn't I already say that?
*"Hmmm, I must be tired"* I said continuing to search for the old ring but I found nothing, I had looked through all three boxes but had found nothing but this old pocket watch.
*"Hey mom, I can't find the dang thing!"* I yelled.
*"Look in the small drawer, there should be one in a corner!"* I heard her yell back.
*"Hey mo-"* *"Huh?"*
*"Yes sweetie?"* my mother replied.
*"Nevermind, I forgot what I was gonna say!"* I said.
I heard her chuckle.
*"You're weird Lisa, guess you're more similar to your dog than me!"* she yelled.
*"Screw you! Now where did you say this ring was again?"* I yelled back.
*"I said it was in a drawer in a corner somewhere!"* she replied.
I looked around and saw a small cabinet with a drawer in the corner, I opened it and yep, there it was, a golden ring with a flawless one-carat diamond attached to it.
*"Damn mom, this thing looks expensive as hell"* I yelled.
*"Yeah, it belonged to my mother once, I just remembered I had-"*
*"Yeah, it belonged to my mother once, I just remembered I had it, I asked you to get it because I felt bad leaving it in the attic!"* She replied
*"Why did you say that twice?"* I said.
*"The fuck are you talking about?"* she replied.]

*"What do you mean? You said that twice, why did you?"* I said
*"Lisa are you feeling alright? I didn't say anything twice."* she replied.
*"Hmmmm... Anyway, I'm on my way to give you the ring, gimme a bit to fold the ladder back up!"* I said
*"Alright"* I heard her yell.
I climbed back down the stairs and jumped at the last few steps before looking down, why was the ground farther away than usual, I'm certain I counted the steps right.
Luckily I landed safely, although that was weird, I shrugged it off as a weird coincidence before hearing my mom yell: *"Lisa? You okay?"*
*"I'm fine don't worry."* I yelled back.
I folded up the ladder and tossed it up, watching the hatch close. *"I'm on my way"* I yelled.
I walked to the kitchen and gave the ring to my mother, she thanked me and continued preparing dinner.
I sat down at the dinner table and waited for mom to finish.
*"Hey what are we eating anyway?"* I asked.
*"Wait you didn't notice? We're having tacos, I thought the smell made it obvious."* she replied.
*"Hmmm well now that you mention it, I guess you're right."* I said.
She grabbed some plates and placed the already filled tacos on them, we both had two tacos filled with some minced meat, corn, tomatoes and lettuce, I was hungry so I had finished quickly.
*"I'm gonna grab a can of coke, you want anything?"* I asked
*"No thanks, I'm fine."* she replied.
I grabbed a can of coke and sat back down at the table, I was about to open the can when something caught my eye.
My plate had two tacos again, I was sure I had eaten both of them!
*"Hey mom, you only prepared four tacos in total right?"* I asked.
She confirmed my suspicion by saying: *"Yep, I made two for you and two for me."*]

*"I could've sworn I ate them"* I murmured.
*"Uhm no, I just placed them on the table, they're brand new."* she said
*"I'll be right back, I need to check something"* I said as I stood up and started walking upstairs.
I walked into the bathroom and sat down, I wasn't sure what was happening but the thing I was about to do might help clear up my confusion.
I raised my hand and pushed my finger into the back of my throat, shivers were sent down my spine and I gagged, I pushed my finger back into my throat until finally a sour liquid was propelled out of my body into the toilet.
*"What in the-"* I said as I looked at the liquid in the toilet, there were pieces of tomato and small pieces of lettuce.
I sat down and tried to process what was happening, I had definitely eaten the tacos as my body could confirm but how were they back on my plate.
Thoughts were racing through my head when I heard a \*clink\*.
I looked where the sound came from, it was the pocket watch I found in the attic.
These weird events started when I found that dang thing, could it be that this old hunk of metal was behind this shit?
*"It can't be? Right?"* I said as I picked it up.
*"The chance was slim but I'd still better do some research."*
I had some time to investigate it was spring break anyway.
I had decided that I was gonna investigate, I just didn't know in what way.
I could give my mom the watch to see if she would act weird or confused but that might rouse suspicions.
I could also try to switch between keeping the watch on me and not keeping it on me by the day.
I decided to pick the latter, I didn't want to rouse any suspicions as to what the watch might be able to do, if this really was a magic object I couldn't let anyone find out.]

I got up and flushed the toilet, I didn't want mom to know I had made myself throw up, she'd get too worried.
I went back downstairs and sat back down on my seat, since my stomach was empty now I might as well just start eating again.
While I was eating I started brainstorming, I decided I'd place the watch in my room tomorrow and see if anything would change, if my day was normal then I'd have some clarity as to what was happening.
Since I hadn't been sleeping well the last few days I decided to go to bed early, I brushed my teeth, washed my mouth and got ready to sleep.
Before I got in bed I placed the watch in a drawer with a lock on it and locked it just in case.
I placed the key under my bed and got in, I closed my eyes as I felt my world fade and fall as I was dragged into the realm of the unconscious...
 ** **
 ** **
*"Where am I?"* I said.
*"Where am I? Where am I? Where am I?"* I heard my voice echo.
The last thing I remembered was getting into bed and falling asleep with that feeling as if I was falling from a massive height.
I got up and tried to find out where I was.
When I was trying to put the pieces together and find out where I was I felt a warm breath on my neck and I looked back.
What I saw was a head of what looked like a dog hanging from a hook, blood dripped from its neck where it had been severed from its original body.
It was still breathing, with every breath it took I heard a slight whimper.
I heard the faint ticking sound of a clock gradually becoming louder as I grew more and more horrified with what was happening until all I heard was an ear-shattering \*tick\* \*tock\* \*tick\* \*tock\*.
I fell to the floor, my body was unable to move, I couldn't do anything but watch as my face came closer and closer to the pitch-black floor until I hit it with a loud \*splat\*.
I woke up drenched in sweat, luckily it was a dream.
I assumed the deafening ticking was just my head processing the events the pocket watch had been causing but why was there a beheaded dog?]

I'd better get out of bed, I was awake now and it was
10:21 AM anyway, I went downstairs and prepared breakfast, I placed everything on the table and called mom downstairs, she responded by saying *"Comin\'"* in a tired voice.
I waited a few minutes for my mom to come downstairs.
*"Damn mom you look like shit."* I said.
*"Screw you!"* She replied.
*"C'mon sit down, let's have breakfast."* I said pointing to the chair she always uses.
So far so good, no weird time stuff had happened yet.
I made myself a sandwich with some peanut butter and jelly, if my suspicions were true today wouldn't be very eventful, so why make a special sandwich when I can just keep it simple.
We finished breakfast and I placed everything back where it uses to be and placed all plates and cutlery in the dishwasher.
I sat down on the couch and turned on the television and watched the news.
According to the news, someone had been shot nearby, someone had drowned in a public pool and there was a heatwave coming tomorrow.
** **
After a few hours of watching television, it was almost time for dinner and I waited for mom to finish ordering, we were having pizza tonight so we had some time to kill before we could eat.
I asked her if she wanted to play a quick game of hangman, she said yes, I didn't play with her a lot so she didn't any chances to do so.
I chose the word *ticking*, I couldn't stop thinking about that damn watch anyway.
*"Does your word have a G?"* she asked me.
I confirmed it by saying: *"Yep."*
*"Hmmmm... Does your word contain an L?"* 
*"Nope, it doesn't."*
She drew a single horizontal line at the bottom of her paper and asked: *"Does your word contain an F?"*
*"Also no-"* I was interrupted by the doorbell ringing.
Mom got up and walked to the door.
*"Hello ma'am, here are your pizzas! That'll be $12.45."*
I didn’t listen to the rest of the conversation because I started getting the table ready for dinner.
I sat down and waited for mom to finish.
*"You done yet?"* I yelled.
*"Yeah yeah, I’m on my way"* she said before thanking the delivery man and closing the door.]

I had a pizza with pepperoni and multiple types of cheese.
I was more than embarrassed when I found out what mom had on her pizza, she had pineapple on her pizza...
*"Mom what the fuck?"* I said
*"What?! I like it! Stop judging me!"* she bit back.
*"You need help mom, seriously, you don't just like pineapple on pizza and not be mentally insane."*
*"Shut up Lisa, you can judge me when you don’t think your tacos were new!"*
I didn't reply, she wouldn't understand nor believe me anyway.
I let mom clean the table today, I went to bed thirty minutes after dinner.
*"You going early?"* mom said.
*"Yeah, I’m tired. Goodnight mom."* I replied
*"Goodnight sweetie."* she replied.
I brushed my teeth and got in bed, I had made a choice, tomorrow was the day I’d destroy that watch, I didn’t care how much it was worth, this thing needed to be destroyed.
I closed my eyes and was once again dragged back into the realm of the unconscious.
** **
** **
I had the same dream as yesterday, I had a hard time understanding why this dream came back again, why that dog head...
I got up and got dressed, grabbed the watch and told mom I was gonna hang out with some friends.
I ran downstairs, grabbed a spare lighter and went out.
It took me a while to find enough dry sticks for a fire but I eventually got enough.
I took the lighter out of my pocket and set the pile on fire before throwing the watch on it.
I watched the watch for a while, the first few minutes were uneventful but after a while, it started falling apart.
Before I could see the watch fully break my vision went black.
** **
** **
*"Hey mom, I can't find the dang thing!"* I yelled.
*"Look in the small drawer, there should be one in a corner!"* I heard her yell back.
*"Hey mo-"*]
