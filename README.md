I am Safira, the one who made Flare . I kindly ask you to give credits to Natasquare , Person , Me and green
None of these peoples helped with the developing of this bot, I single handedly coded this bot from scratch. The music codes are edited by me, but made by green. Discord.js codes are made by Natasquare and Person
```

🚀 Bug fixes
```js
If you do not want to encounter any bugs do the following steps
* if you want to stop the bot from leaving the server go to ./commands/developer/bot leaves the server ( delete if wanted ).js, and delete that file IF you don't want to have the 30 members or more limit

* To not make the bot go offline change the channelID in the index.js from the ready event, you can find this by scrolling down in the index.js file

* To make the bot work edit your token in ./config.js
```

🚀 Provide credits
```js
* Make a credits command and provide credits to me by using my discord tag or my github repo
* Advertise my support server
* By editing the footer of the help command, or from all commands saying " Made by 🌺 Safira#0001 "
```
