How to use my code 

```

🔹 Go to your config.js and add your token

🔹 Then click on the button that will boot up the bot

🔹 Use the latest version of aoi.js
```

🔹 Enjoy!

Why do i want my credits
I don't like it when people make mass copies of my bot and claim that they made it. I did not add credits in its code so i ask for you to add the credits in a way i and the people can notice

🔹 __Emoji support__
I do not give support / share my emojis with anyone, which means i will **not** invite your bot to my server as i do not want it to nuke my servers

🔹 __Advertising it__
You can absolutely **not** submit your bot on any advertising website ( ex: top.gg , voidsbots , discordbots, etc ) as i will make sure it gets removed

__What if i just use some commands?__
You can use as many commands as you want just give me credits in a way i can notice

🔹 __I found a bug what do i do__
Join the support server bellow

🔹 __How to support me__
Nitro is appreciated / boosting the server as it helps me alot

As always enjoy using my code free of charge
I might update it when version 6.0.0 comes along
