🔹 __Why do i want my credits__

I don't like it when people make mass copies of my bot and claim that they made it. I did not add credits in its code so i ask for you to add the credits in a way i and the people can notice

🔹 __Emoji support__

I do not give support / share my emojis with anyone, which means i will **not** invite your bot to my server as i do not want it to nuke my servers

🔹 __Advertising it__

You can absolutely **not** submit your bot on any advertising website ( ex: top.gg , voidsbots , discordbots, etc ) as i will make sure it gets removed

🔹 __What if i just use some commands?__

You can use as many commands as you want just give me credits in a way i can notice

🔹 __I found a bug what do i do__

Join the support server bellow

🔹 __How to support me__
