I am Safira, the one who made Flare . I kindly ask you to give credits to Natasquare , Person , Me and green
None of these peoples helped with the developing of this bot, I single handedly coded this bot from scratch. The music codes are edited by me, but made by green. Discord.js codes are made by Natasquare and Person
